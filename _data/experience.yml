    Worked on a bio-inspired geometric model for sound reconstruction.
    The spectrum of the degraded sound is lifted in the Heisenberg group
    and reconstructed via the Wilson-Cowan differo-integral equation.

    Contributed to an [article](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80209-7_7)
    published in the [GSI 2021](https://www.see.asso.fr/en/GSI2021) conference proceedings.

    Improved and extended the [implementation](https://github.com/rand-asswad/WCA1)
    of the proposed model, and ran experiments on a library of speech recordings.

    This internship concluded my Master's degree at INSA Rouen Normandie
    ([published report](https://rand-asswad.xyz/WCA1-docs/)).

    algorithm developped by [Pixel team](https://pixel.inria.fr) that proposes a robust pipeline
    for generating hexahedral-dominant meshes from any global parametrization of a tetrahedral mesh.
    
    Proposed and implemented improvements to the pipeline that helped obtain better meshes with
    less irregularities.
